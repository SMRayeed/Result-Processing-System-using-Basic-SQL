# Result-Processing-System-using-Basic-SQL
This project is about Result Processing System which is an automated system that will generate & record the result (GPA) of the students in each semester. Besides the system will also have a record of the results of a student in each course at each semester along with obtained marks so that he/she can evaluate himself/herself. 
Also, the system keeps track of the tuition fee remaining for each student. In addition, this also provides a feature to determine whether a student will be eligible to sit for the exam or not, depending on his/her attendance percentage.
